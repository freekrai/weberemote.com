You're comfortable with Node.js and front-end development in general.

You love trying out new languages, frameworks, libraries, and leveraging them off, whenever necessary.

You’re looking for projects that you'll be proud to share with your friends and family, and you're interested in scaling MVPs that disrupt markets and build business.

You know when to ask more questions and where to look for answers.

If you're not looking to advance your skills and work along Senior Developers committed to helping you do that, this isn't for you!
