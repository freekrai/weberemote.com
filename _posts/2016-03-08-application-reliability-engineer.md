We're looking for someone to join our Engineering and DevOps team at Zapier. Are you interested in helping [scale and automate the billions of tasks](https://zapier.com/engineering/automating-billions-of-tasks/) connecting the world's business data? Then read on…  

## About You

You are a hybrid software engineer. You can cross systems, DevOps, and application software boundaries. You have a history of shipping high-quality production code in Python. You are skilled working directly on the command line. You are embrace automation and take pride in building internal tools to help your team be more efficient. You are not afraid to jump into application code to ship a new feature or infrastructure code to help scale a system.

You solve challenges involving scaling, reliability, high availability, data pipelines, micro-services, and more in your day-to-day work.

You are comfortable building and scaling applications on one or more technologies that make up our AWS stack, including Python, Django, RabbitMQ, Zookeeper, Docker, Kafka, Redis, Memcache, Postgres, MySQL, Elasticsearch, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible and more.

You have experience working with databases. You are comfortable modeling database schemas and writing queries across a variety of data sources. You are able to work with data scientists to help understand what's happening in a production system and how to use it intelligently.

You have worked with teams before scaling large projects. You understand that automation plays a critical role in scaling. You have designed and implemented systems in a distributed manner and are comfortable scaling these systems across hundreds (and even thousands) of servers. You have no problem keeping systems like these running even while you sleep…because you've automated it.

You love doing things efficiently. At Zapier, the work you do will have a disproportionate impact on the business. We believe in systems and processes that let us scale our impact to be larger than ourselves.

You love learning. Engineering is an ever-evolving world. You enjoy playing with new tech and exploring areas that you might not have experience with yet.

You love to set your own direction. At Zapier, we have one team meeting each week and one-on-one meetings every month. Between those we chat in Slack and then go make things happen.

You are friendly and patient, welcoming, considerate, and respectful. Learn more about these attributes in our [code of conduct](https://zapier.com/jobs/zapier-code-of-conduct/).

## Things You Might Do

Zapier is a startup, so you'll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization. Here are some things you'll get a taste of:

- Be an important member of our Engineering and DevOps team, working to scale our fast growing and unique system

- Write application code to support new features

- Build tooling to increase visibility into our running production systems, measure performance continuously, and act upon changes

- Automate disaster recovery efforts, including introducing random "chaos" into the system to test and improve overall resiliency to failures

- Tune the engine that supports hundreds of thousands of users every day

- Give back to the community via open source and blog posts

- Help customers via support to ensure they have the best experience possible

## About Zapier

For the past four years, Zapier has been helping people across the world automate the boring and tedious parts of their job. We do that by helping everyone connect the web applications they already use and love.

We believe that there are jobs a computer is best at doing and that there are jobs a human is best at doing. We want to empower businesses to create processes and systems that let computers do what they are best at doing and let humans do what they are best at doing.

We believe that with the right tools, you can have big impact with less hassle.

We believe in small teams. Small teams are fast and nimble. Small teams mean less bureaucracy and less management and more getting things done.

We believe that credentials don't say everything. Our CTO has a finance degree. Our CEO has an engineering degree. Our CPO has a mechanical engineering degree. What you love doing is way more important than the credentials you have.
