We're looking for a Ruby engineer to help us build a set of microservices for our next generation email sending platform.

### Challenge

In order to make our customers experience solid and hassle-free we started building a set of external services and APIs: uptime monitoring, automatic queue triggering, premium version packaging and ultimately email delivery.

### Benefits

We are a 100% remote company accepting candidates from countries in European and American (East Coast) time zones. Everything happens on Slack, with a one-hour Monday meeting to organize the week and some occasional emails.

No strict work hours, no fixed vacation days, just goals, getting things done. You'll travel at least once a year.

### Who We Are

We're a 4-year old, completely bootstrapped, profitable, 9 person company. Our WordPress newsletter plugin is used by over 300,000 websites.

Our product-centric team consists of 4 developers, 3 support staff, 1 marketing chief & 1 product chief. We're spread over 7 countries.

### Skills
We strive for software minimalism, requiring:

- Good object oriented design.
- Plain Ruby experience (we don't use Rails).
- Sinatra/Rack.
- Minitest.
- Basic understanding of REST.

It would be really great if you have interest in:

- Software security.
- Devops (we use Ansible)

How to apply

Please send us email to jobs at our domain name with:

- Name and email.
- Link to your profile/website/blog (no attachments please).
- Your two best projects.
- What made you fall in love with Ruby.

We don't outsource to agencies. Due to the amount of emails we receive, please include all the information listed above.
