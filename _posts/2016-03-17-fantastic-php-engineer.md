You're ready for a long-term fit with the flexibility to create your best work, again and again.

### About the Job

At Clevertech, we understand why it’s great to be part of the gig economy—we also understand some of the challenges it can present.

By offering ongoing, full-time roles, we eliminate the burnout and guesswork involved in being a contract worker. We’re also interested in making it possible for our team to focus on what they do best. Busy work that gets in the way of high-quality code is our worst enemy!

### Here’s how it works:

- We work with quality clients who have brilliant ideas they want to scale, scale, scale :)
- Schedules are flexible—you work when you're in flow, from wherever you wish
- You focus on one client at a time; when you're finished with one, we provide another
- We use the latest tools and streamline every workflow imaginable
- Everyone on our team shares your culture, irrespective of where they are physically
