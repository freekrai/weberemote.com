Hi there, I'm Danny Schreiber, the marketing director at Zapier.

Over the past two years, the Zapier marketing team has worked hard to establish the Zapier Blog as a trusted resource for professionals to learn about the best software. From evaluating hundreds of tools, including CRMs, task management apps and email marketing systems, to putting dozens of productivity strategies to the test, we've published more than 150 in-depth articles. These pieces have a weekly readership of more than 50,000 email subscribers and pull in nearly 500,000 monthly unique pageviews.

With this foundation set, we're looking for a writer who will team up with us take this resource to the next levelâ€”reach 1 million unique pageviews per month by year's end. We'll do it through more long-form content that, as always, helps our readers work smarter.
