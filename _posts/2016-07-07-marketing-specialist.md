    Hello! I'm Danny Schreiber with the marketing team at Zapier. We're looking for someone who's eager to help rapidly grow our user base of 1M+, create content that helps customers succeed, and build meaningful relationships with partners.We're a 100% remote team—located across 10 time zones—and though we each have our own roles, we take time to help each other learn new skills and strategies.Zapier is just about 50 people today and growing. We get together 2-3 per year for a company retreat (next one is in August in Whistler, British Columbia), and benefits include great healthcare, dental and vision coverage, 401k retirement plan with company match, profit sharing and 14 weeks paid leave for new parents.
