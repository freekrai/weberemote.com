<div>I&apos;ve designed and developed a promising new hybrid poker app and website that needs to be moved to a native app. &#xA0;I&apos;ve launched version 1.0 of the hybrid app. &#xA0;User experience is lacking and there are more features and iterations that need to be added. &#xA0;The good news is that someone can see exactly how it works. I&apos;m thinking iOS (Swift) first and Android (Java) second.</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div>This is a private software project that&apos;s being funded with private money. &#xA0;I&apos;m an individual, not a company, so you&apos;ll deal directly with me. This is a passion that could turn into something more. I&apos;m looking for someone who&apos;s equally passionate about the work they do.</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div>I&apos;m located in Westchester, NY. It&apos;s not necessary that you live nearby. It&apos;s all about the quality of your work If you play poker a big plus!&#xA0;</div>
