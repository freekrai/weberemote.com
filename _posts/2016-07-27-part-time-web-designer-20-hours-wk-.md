<div>Howdy howdy! It&apos;s that time again - time to find the next person to continue making Devschool, the best online coding bootcamp in 2016! This time around we need a designer that wants to get shit done, not just push pixels around for hours with no goal in mind.</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div>To start, you will take our website&#xA0;to the next level, taking &apos;ugly&apos; sections like the elective pills, and making them nice. You get to work from home, and we could care less if you do your work while smoking on a bong or vape, or for the matter, drinking a whiskey or scotch. Do the job in your underwear if that is what makes you creative.</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div>To start, this is only part time, however, prove yourself to be one of the &apos;gets shit done&apos; types and we can easily ramp your hours to 35 hours a week!</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div>What do we want to see? What skills do you need?</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div>You should know that a huge percent of websites use the Canvas template. Your designs done in photoshop or other pro tool should be easily converted to html/css. The right person for this job will be responsible for not just the photoshop work, but also the html/css aspect. We also use bootstrap to produce responsive designs.</div>
