<div>I&apos;ve designed and developed a promising new poker app and website that needs a front end developer. &#xA0;I&apos;ve launched version 1.0 of the app and website, but it needs a lot of iterations. &#xA0;There is a lead developer on the project, but he can only devote a certain number of hours a week toward the project. &#xA0;This is a private software project that&apos;s being funded with private money. I&apos;m an individual, not a company, so you&apos;ll deal directly with me. This is a passion that could turn into something more. I&apos;m looking for someone who&apos;s equally passionate about the work they do.</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div>I&apos;m located in Westchester, NY. It&apos;s not necessary that you live nearby. It&apos;s all about the quality of your work If you play poker a big plus!&#xA0;</div>
