<div><strong>[2-3 Month Contract][USA or Europe or South America]</strong> We are looking for a Node.js developer with GraphQL experience to join a small team to help build an API for a really interesting mobile application. Demonstrable interest and/or contribution to the GraphQL ecosystem (whether through issues, conference attendance, PRs, open source projects) is recommended. If you happen to be a full stack developer and love react/redux that is a huge bonus, but not required for this project!&#xA0;</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
