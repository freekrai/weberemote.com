<div><strong>The Role</strong></div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div>We&#x2019;re looking for a tech-savvy people person to join our superpowered 
squad of customer service pros. Our product serves an amazing community 
of business owners, bloggers, and social media professionals, and you&#x2019;ll
 be on the front lines for answering their questions and keeping them 
happy as heck.</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div>Edgar launched in Summer 2014, and we already have thousands of happy, 
paying, fabulous customers. We&#x2019;re also growing by about ~20% month over 
month, which means lots of users - and lots of support! Fortunately, 
you&#x2019;re an empathetic and articulate communicator with an outlook so 
positive it&#x2019;s almost creepy. You love people? We love you.</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div><strong>About You</strong></div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div>- You live anywhere in the continental US (and can provide documentation of eligibility to work in the USA)<br></div><div>- Full Time - 40 hours a week; 7am - 3pm or 8am - 4pm Eastern Time (Your first three weeks will be from 9am - 5pm ET)<br></div><div>- You&#x2019;re super comfortable with social media (like, sweatpants-level comfortable)<br></div><div>- You&apos;ll be helping our customers out with general questions, techie-type troubleshooting, and a wee bit of salesy stuff<br></div><div>- You&#x2019;re motivated, proactive, and totally into technology<br></div><div>- You want to make lots of people super happy!</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div>Your greatest talent in life is putting people at ease and making them 
feel heard. (Or juggling chainsaws, because that&#x2019;d be SO COOL.) You 
don&#x2019;t take it personally when someone has a complaint, so when the going
 gets salty, you stay sweet and bounce right back to help out whoever&#x2019;s 
next in line. We live on the Internet, so you&#x2019;re a master of written 
communication and can always tell whether someone needs a quick answer 
or a little extra hand-holding. You love working with tech, exploring 
new tools and apps, and using your black belt in Google Fu to find 
resourceful solutions for the most problem-y problems.</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div>We&#x2019;re into CS that&#x2019;s smart, proactive, and actually helpful, so don&#x2019;t expect to spend day after day getting smacked in the face with complaints and sending the same soul-sucking form responses to people. (That&#x2019;s SO not your style.) You&#x2019;re a translator who speaks 1000 dialects of Customer-ese, so when somebody has a problem, you know how to suss out the issue at its heart and put their pain point in your crosshairs. You&#x2019;ve got a mind of your own, and you&#x2019;re looking for a job that&#x2019;ll let you use it, and make serious contributions outside of just answering emails. (Even though you&#x2019;re a total pro at it.)</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div>And you know, you&#x2019;re a just-plain-swell human being. (It&#x2019;s okay for you to admit that!) Customer service takes smarts AND a sparkling personality, and yours sparkles like a diamond fresh out of the dishwasher. You love being part of an awesome team, but you&#x2019;re also good at the whole self-management thing - you&#x2019;re in charge of a lot of your own workflow, so you&#x2019;ve gotta be able to focus and prioritize without anyone creepily staring at you over the wall of a cubicle.</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div>
