We live in Slack, have daily video standups and some of us like to meet up occasionally to work together from coworking spaces like Google Campus. We will also be happy to pay for coworking space near you if you need it. We&#x2019;re a small, friendly team and we like to think of ourselves as a family :) If all this resonates with you, then we would love to hear from you!</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br></div><div><strong>In Brief</strong></div><div>We are looking for an outstanding software engineer to join us and help take Resource Guru to new heights as one of the world&#x2019;s leading productivity apps.
