# Atomic Squirrel

## Company blurb

[Atomic Squirrel](http://www.atomic-squirrel.net/) specializes in helping startups get off the ground.

Launching a startup is a long, complicated, and confusing process. Most startups hire an experienced lawyer who they can call every time they have a legal question. Now you can hire an experienced startup team who you can call every time you have a product, technology, or team question. You can think of Atomic Squirrel as a "co-founder as a service."

We have helped many companies with product design, marketing strategy, data-driven development, system architecture, infrastructure development, coding practices, production deployment, scalability, research, recruiting, training, and much more. So no matter what your startup is struggling with, we can fill in the gaps.

## Company size

The core team is 2 people: 

* [Yevgeniy Brikman](http://www.ybrikman.com) is the founder of [Atomic Squirrel](http://www.atomic-squirrel.net/). He is the author of [Hello, Startup](http://www.hello-startup.net/), a comprehensive guide to building products, technologies, and teams in a startup environment. Jim has more than a decade of experience building infrastructure and products at LinkedIn, TripAdvisor, Cisco Systems, and Thomson Financial. He's also active in the [open source community](https://github.com/brikis98/), maintains a [popular blog](http://www.ybrikman.com/writing), and has given [talks](http://www.ybrikman.com/speaking/) at conferences all over the world.

* [Josh Padnick](https://joshpadnick.com/) is the founder of [Phoenix DevOps](http://phoenixdevops.com/) and [Omedix](https://omedix.com/), and is a professional DevOps + AWS Consultant. He has helped a wide range of software teams to achieve DevOps success, including Intel, Infusionsoft, American Bible Society, and many others. He recently published a [12,000+ Word Guide to Building Scalable Web Apps on AWS](https://www.airpair.com/aws/posts/building-a-scalable-web-app-on-amazon-web-services-p1) which garnered 500+ upvotes on Hacker News, has hosted 150+ websites on AWS, and built cloud apps on AWS for 100,000+ users.

## Remote status
