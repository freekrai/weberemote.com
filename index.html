<h1 class="resize-h2">Remote Jobs for Hackers &amp; other Superheroes.</h1>

<p>This isn't your average job board.  It's a collection of gigs that will make your inner nerd giddy and leave you wondering why you ever settled for an average nine-to-fiver.  Nothing unpaid.  No recruiter spam.  Just remote gigs that we would have wanted to have ourselves.</p>

<p>Want to know when a new job gets posted?  Enter your email below and we'll let you know.  Don't worry, we don't spam and you can unsubscribe whenever!</p>
